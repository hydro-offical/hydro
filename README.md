## What is DeFi?

​			The use of technology in financial services is not new. Most transactions at banks or other financial services companies are accomplished with the help of technology nowadays. However, the role of technology is restricted to being a facilitator of such transactions. Companies still have to contend with navigating the legalese of jurisdictions, competing financial markets, and different standards to make a transaction possible. With its stack of common software protocols and public blockchains to build them on, DeFi places technology at the front and center of transactions in the financial services industry.



## DIFI

- DeFi is distinct because it expands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex financial use cases.


- Decentralized finance, or DeFi, aims to use technology to remove intermediaries between parties in a financial transaction.


- The components of DeFi are stablecoins, use cases, and a software stack that enables development of applications.



## DeFi services now in use allow you to:

Borrow and lend cryptocurrencies to earn interest using platforms such as Compound or Aave.
Bet on the outcome of events using Augur.
Create and exchange derivatives of real-world assets such as currencies or precious metals on Synthetix.
Take part in a no-loss lottery on PoolTogether, where everyone gets their money back and one lucky participant wins all the interest that has accrued in a shared pot.
Buy cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins, which are pegged to the value of a particularly currency or commodity. For example, DAI and USDC are both pegged to the US dollar.
